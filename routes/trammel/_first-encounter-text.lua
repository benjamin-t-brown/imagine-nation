return {
[ 1 ] = { [[  MAN'S VOICE: "Well well well what do we have here?" You sit up from
  your impact on the ground and find yourself looking up at the face of
  the sleeping man whom you had seen earlier. He certainly is not
  sleeping anymore though. He looms over you with his hat in hands and a
  wicked grin on his face.]] },
[ 2 ] = { [[  MAN'S VOICE: "Oh, nothing but a trick of the mind, my dear, although
  you should know all about that."]] },
[ 3 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "Allow me to explain. My name is Mr. Trammel. I'm not
  really anybody significant, just what you might call a 'wanderer' or
  perhaps in your case a 'parasite'." He flashes a grin at you. "I was
  just passing by when I spotted this wonderful place and decided that I
  simpy must stick around."]] },
[ 4 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "Why, my dear, we are inside your mind. I thought you must
  have realized that by now?"]] },
[ 5 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "Indeed. Everything you see around you has been constructed
  by your subconscious mind. Every. Single. Thing." He plucks a leaf off
  of the aspen tree behind him. "This also means that anything in here
  can also be deconstructed by your mind as well." He holds the leaf out
  to you, and when you take it, the leaf disintegrates in your hands.]] },
[ 6 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "Because I find this place so very interesting." You frown
  in confusion. "Tis the only place like it that is so well-defined!
  Look around you, my dear. Does it not feel real. I could bring anybody
  into this place and they would not know the difference between the
  world and your mind." He brings his face down to your level. "Quite
  frankly, I find the thought of that fascinating."]] },
[ 7 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "Exactly what I said. I knew nothing of this place until
  recently. I just happened to notice it and I got curious." He shrugs.
  "These things tend to happen from time to time."]] },
[ 8 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "But shall we get down to business? More specifically, let
  us discus the reason why I have brought you in here." His face is now
  deadly serious, showing no sign that it had been madly grinning not a
  moment ago. "While I have given your mind some considerable praise,
  you should know that almost everything you see is a lie. There are
  many places in your mind where even I would not dare to go.
  Dangerious, vile, and diseased places that plague the depths of this
  world, hiding out of sight, pushed away from the surface. And only a
  tenuous force keeps this filth at bay."]] },
[ 9 ] = { [[  He pauses and indicates the ground. You are still sitting on the patch
  of dirt and bush that you had landed on before. He takes his hand and,
  like a knife through butter, scoops out a rough square foot of the
  dirt, which disintegrates just like the leaf you held earlier. In the
  hole that remains is a puddle of black tar. Mr Trammel uses his other
  hand to scoop out the tar. It smells disgusting and you flinch away
  from it. And that's when you notice that it's a moving, living liquid,
  oozing over Tremmel's hands dripping to the ground and trying to slide
  away from the hole from which it came.]] },
[ 10 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "This is what is beneath your feet everywhere you walk." He
  scoops up the tar and dispenses it in the hole. As he does so, the dirt
  around it begins to crumble and meld and soon it is filled with dirt
  just as it had been before. You see no sign that the black stuff was
  there at all.]] },
[ 11 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "This is your mind. You figure it out. I just thought you
  ought to know about it."]] },
[ 12 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "You can leave any time you want. You just have to tell
  your mind to let you go." He has now reverted back to his obnoxious
  grinning.]] },
[ 13 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "Sounds simple right? Why don't you try?"]] },
[ 14 ] = { [[  You close your eyes and try to tell your mind to let you leave. You
  feel an odd sensation and you open your eyes.]] },
[ 15 ] = { [[  You sit in the same place as before, looking directly at Mr Trammel's
  face.]] },
[ 16 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "Looks like you don't have very good control over your
  mind, my dear." He stands and plucks another leaf from the tree behind
  him. "But I stand by what I said: you simply have to tell your mind to
  let you leave. However, I'm sure you realize something by now. Your
  mind is wild and has a will of it's own. It takes some considerable
  effort to reel it in and tell it what to do."]] },
[ 17 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "Well it seems that I may understand you better than you
  do!" He laughs.]] },
[ 18 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "A good question, one that many people besides you have
  asked. I don't have the answer to your question, but I suppose I could
  give you some advice." He holds his hands out in front of himself and a
  smokey globe appears between them. On it you can see Conscience,
  frantically running through thick forest, falling down and getting up
  again.]] },
[ 19 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "You have met her right? I believe her name is Conscience?"
  You nod. "She's a pretty smart kid, kind-hearted and curious; has a lot
  of potential if you know what I mean." Once again his face abruptly
  turns serious. "But you won't find anybody else in here willing to
  admit that of her, and I find that both odd and sad."]] },
[ 20 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "I suggest you discover the origins of this... tragedy." He
  looks morosely at Conscience running in the orb.]] },
[ 21 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "Not good." That's all he's willing to say.]] },
[ 22 ] = { [[  MR TRAMMEL: "I have already told you more than my better judgement has
  advised me." He snaps his fingers and the orb disappears. "I'll be
  around if you want to find me, although I can't see why you would.
  Like I said, I enjoy this place, so I don't think that I'll be leaving
  too soon." He turns his back and waves his hand. "Don't get too wrapped
  up in here."]] },
