  sky and obscuring the stars above. It is pure silky white, and
  although it looks clean, it is also distinctly opaque and impossible
  to see through for more than a few feet. You also notice that the mist
  swirls around in gusts, but you do not feel even the slightest drag of
  a breeze.]] },

  mists. It reads, "THE MISTED STEPPES – Those who are focused and

  fog swirling about. The only other direction you can easily go is is
  through a valley to the west.]] },
[ 10 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "Before we go, there's one thing I haven't told you." You
  pause and look back at her. She takes a deep breath. "Logos told me
  once how to escape from the mist. He told me that if you think that
  you're lost and you want to leave, all you have to do is close your
  eyes and imagine the last place you were, and the mist will take you
  there."]] },
