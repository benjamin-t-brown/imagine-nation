[ 1 ] = { [[  The forest abruptly ends with you and Conscience stepping up to a cliff
  overhang. Looking out, you see that you stand at the east end of the
  largest canyon you have ever seen. It is truly a beautiful sight:
  brown rocks reflect the sunlight creating cascading shades of colors
  that you never thought a bunch of rocks could make. You see a river at
  the base of the canyon that looks like it could be a half mile down
  from where you stand. You step back from the cliff edge so that you
  are not in danger of toppling down there.]] },
[ 2 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "If we have to cross that, I hope there's a bridge close
  by, or that's going to be a pretty tough climb."]] },
[ 3 ] = { [[  You go back to search for the road, and find after some walking that it
  winds it's way south until it comes to a sturdy-looking concrete
  bridge. It is surrounded by a chain-link fence, with a gate where it
  intersects the road. A square building with tinted windows stands by
  the bridge. You begin to walk towards it the fence, but Conscience
  grabs your wrist immediately pulls you back behind a rock.]] },
[ 4 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "Look, there's somebody patrolling!" She points where there
  is indeed a man walking around the perimeter of the chain link fence,
  disappearing behind the forest to the south before emerging a few
  minutes later walking back the way from which he left.]] },
[ 5 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "Listen. If we are seen, it could be really bad. We need to
  find a way past them without them noticing. I really mean it!" You can
  sense the urgency in her voice. You turn back to the fence and begin
  to formulate a plan to get across the bridge.]] },
