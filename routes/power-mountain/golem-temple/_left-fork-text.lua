[ 1 ] = { [[  You walk for a few minutes with Conscience happily skipping at your
  side. She seems thrilled to have a traveling companion, and you have
  to admit you feel better not having to be alone anymore. You
  eventually come upon a closed metal door that does not have a handle.]] },
[ 2 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "This is the door I found!". She rushes over to it, but her
  excitement turns to dejection in the blink of an eye. "But I still
  don't know how to get past it." You walk up next to her and survey the
  door for yourself.]] },
[ 3 ] = { [[  You decide that you cannot pass this door at the moment.]] },
[ 4 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "Of course I tried that. It's locked though, you can see
  for yourself."]] },
[ 5 ] = { [[  You put some force on the door, which doesn't budge, and note that you
  probably could not push your way past it.]] },
[ 6 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "I don't have the slightest clue who put them up or what
  keeps them lit."]] },
[ 7 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "Like I said, I am just as lost in this place as you are."]] },
[ 8 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "I noticed that too. Maybe you aren't supposed to open it
  with a handle?"]] },
[ 9 ] = { [[  She pauses a moment to consider the door, and then her face lights up.
  CONSCIENCE: "That must be it! Maybe we just have to ask it?" Before
  you can stop her from undertaking such ridiculousness, Conscience has
  already laid a hand on the outside of the door. "Hello? Mr. Door? It
  would be super great if you could please open up for us?"]] },
[ 10 ] = { [[  The door doesn't do anything. You don't want to admit it, but for a
  moment there you thought that it might have been that easy.]] },
[ 11 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "Thanks, <player_name>. We'll get through eventually!"]] },
[ 12 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "If it had worked, I doubt you would be complaining about
  its silliness."]] },
[ 13 ] = { [[  CONSCIENCE: "I don't see *you* coming up with any good ideas!"]] },
[ 14 ] = { [[  At that moment the wall next to the door begins to move. It extrudes
  out steadily, the rocks grinding together with echoing crumbles. You
  and Conscience are too surprised to move as you watch the wall slide
  out and then slowly come to a stop. Then you notice that it is shaped
  vaugely humanoid: Something like a big, rocky head is lowering down to
  the both of you, two sockets with glowing gems and a mouth of cobbled
  together stones. Whatever the thing is, it moves slowly and
  deliberately, gazing at the two of you for a long moment before
  speaking in a hoarse, but loud voice.]] },
[ 15 ] = { [[  ROCK CREATURE: "Why do you make such noise? I require silence for my
  slumber. It has been agreed."]] },
[ 16 ] = { [[  You are shocked for only a moment before you manage to regain your
  composure. When you do, you find Conscience clutching your arm and
  standing behind you.]] },
[ 17 ] = { [[  Conscience is too terrified to be of any assistance. Her eyes are wide
  and her mouth trembles and she cannot seem to say a word.]] },
[ 18 ] = { [[  The creature does not appear to understand your question.]] },
[ 19 ] = { [[  ROCK CREATURE: "I am here. I am always here. It has been agreed."]] },
[ 20 ] = { [[  The creature heaves a sigh, which involves much grinding of boulders
  and the sound of a wind that you do not feel. It sends shivers down
  your spine nonetheless.]] },
[ 21 ] = { [[  ROCK CREATURE: "I am not to be disturbed. It has been agreed."]] },
[ 22 ] = { [[  It moves its face right next to the both of you; Conscience's
  fingernails cut into your arm painfully. However, the pose isn't
  threatening, but seems... considering.]] },
[ 23 ] = { [[  ROCK CREATURE: "Anger does not befit me. You will leave this temple
  now. You will not come back. It has been agreed."]] },
[ 24 ] = { [[  It turns to the door that you and Conscience could not get past and
  with an effortless nudge, swings it open, slamming it against
  something on the other side.]] },
[ 25 ] = { [[  Without another word it swoops the two of you up in its other hand and
  ushers you out. The door slams shut behind you, the metal ringing
  loudly, echoing all around. The light of the outside temporarily
  blinds you and you shield your eyes. When they finally adjust to the
  sun...]] },
[ 26 ] = { [[  You walk for a few minutes past row after row of torches until you are
  forced to stop: the passage onward is marred by a large, metal door.
  This door, like the previous one you saw, does not appear to have a
  handle. It looms down on you as if daring you to touch it.]] },
[ 27 ] = { [[  You notice that the cave floor beneath your feet has turned into a
  cobblestone path.]] },
[ 28 ] = { [[  You decide that you cannot pass this door at the moment.]] },
[ 29 ] = { [[  At first you nudge the door and find that it is locked tight. You then
  push harder and harder, but your feet slip on the rock beneath you. It
  looks like you aren't strong enough to push it open.]] },
[ 30 ] = { [[  You kick the door and receive a throbbing pain in your toe,
  accomplishing little else. The door remains as tightly shut as when
  you first saw it.]] },
[ 31 ] = { [[  You chuck the plank of wood at the door. It makes a loud "clank" and
  falls to the floor. You swear you hear a brief sound, like the
  grinding of rocks, but when you freeze and look around, you do not see
  anything.]] },
