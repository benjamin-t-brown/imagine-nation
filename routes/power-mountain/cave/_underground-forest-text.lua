[ 1 ] = { [[  You see stream winding its way through this passage, extruding out of
  the left wall and continuing further on. It seems to be the same water
  that was in the pool somewhere above you. It blocks your path. A
  massive tree trunk grows out of one of the walls, its roots firmly
  entrenched between broken boulders and other thick rocks. The stream
  goes directly underneath it at one point.]] },
[ 2 ] = { [[  The stream is very shallow and you have no problem skipping over it.
  However, once you get to the other side you see clearly that the cave
  has a very sharp drop off. You follow the stream down the cavern a
  ways and discover that it makes its way off of the cliff edge. It
  seems you cannot continue this way. You go back to the entrance of the
  room.]] },

[ 4 ] = { [[  It appears to be dead. Its wood is dry, and its roots seem to be
  withering.]] },
[ 5 ] = { [[  At second glance, though, you notice something rather odd: the stream
  brushes up against one of the tree's roots, yet somehow the root is
  still extremely dry.]] },
[ 6 ] = { [[  How strange! Upon closer inspection, you see that the stream actually
  runs beneath the root, which is single-handedly holding up the cave
  floor above it by floating on the stream. You wonder if there is
  another pool of water under your feet, and if this tree is the only
  thing keeping you dry. Perhaps because the tree is so dry, it does not
  absorb the water and remains buoyant. A piece of the tree's bark juts
  out from the root. The wood's powerful buoyancy seems useful, so you
  break it off and carry it with you.]] },
