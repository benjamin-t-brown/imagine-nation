[ 1 ] = { [[  You stand inside of a massive cavern, cracks on the ceiling allowing
  slim rays of sunlight to cascade off of the walls. Stalagmites line
  the ceiling above a pool of water that dominates the majority of the
  walking space. You see an exit across the pool of water, and you also
  see a smaller path that leads further underground. You hear a very
  feint voice, almost not there, calling out from a passageway across
  the pool.]] },
[ 2 ] = { [[  You have no idea how deep this pool is. It could be too deep to wade
  through.]] },
[ 3 ] = { [[  You find a pebble and toss it into the pool. Eerily, it does not make a
  splashing sound or any ripples. Something seems very off about this
  "water".]] },
[ 4 ] = { [[  You dive into the pool holding firmly onto the plank of dry wood you
  had found before. It floats up and takes you with it, allowing you to
  use your feet to kick your way across the water. After a bit of time
  you are safely on the other bank. You get out of the water sopping wet
  and continue onward. To your surprise, the passage out is marked with a
  thick, wooden door that does not have a handle. Luckily it is unlocked
  and you can push it open, but it is so heavy that it takes a lot of
  strength to do so. When you finally get through, the door slams shut
  behind you and astonishingly seems to morph into the wall. All you see
  now is a large wall of rock. You suppose you have no way back.]] },
[ 5 ] = { [[  You dive into the pool and realize that this was a mistake. The pool is
  very deep, and something is not quite right about the water. You cannot
  float on it; the pool pulls you under even as you are only a few feet
  from the bank. You kick hard but you are unable to get enough force to
  float up. You slip deeper and deeper into the water until you fall
  through a waterfall and land painfully on the cave floor. Gasping for
  air, you stand up.]] },
