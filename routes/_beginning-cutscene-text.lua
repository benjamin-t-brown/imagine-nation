  intermediate state between asleep and awake, but just now something
  has made you feel a bit strange. You slowly open your eyes, and to
  your alarm you discover that you are not in the same place you were
  when you first closed them. In fact, you have no idea where you are.
  You cannot remember anything.]] }

  speckled with numerous stars that dimly light up the landscape. At a

  light, although it seems very far away. In fact, your steps do not
  appear to make a difference in how bright it becomes. It still looms
  just as far away from when you first perceived it, even as you walk
  more and more.]] }

  of that light. You stop and look back into pitch black darkness. It
  seems your only hope is to continue toward the point and perhaps,
  eventually, you will you reach it.]] }

  somehow, gone from very far away to very close.]] }

  doorway, but across the threshold is a thin material that seems to
  shimmer. This is the source of the light. You find it difficult to
  look away from this gateway. It is enthralling, but somehow it demands
  your attention. You notice too late that something is pulling you into
  it, an invisible force, grabing at you and forcing you forward inch by
  inch. You try to resist, but your efforts are fruitless. The force
  grows stronger and stronger and you begin to realize that you can do
  nothing to stop it. It lifts you off of the air, and sucks you into
  the shimmering surface of the portal...]] }
